# Bundled toolchain licenses

One place to see the license texts of everything these images redistribute.
Files here are either copied from the toolchain trees inside the image, or
fetched (sha256-pinned) from the exact upstream revisions when the binary
release ships no texts of its own.

`web` and `android` are built on `base`, so both inherit every `base` row.

| Image | Component | File(s) here | Origin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| base | Node.js | `node-LICENSE` | copied from the digest-pinned `node:24-trixie-slim` image |
| base | Rust (rustc, cargo, std) | `rust/` | copied from the digest-pinned `rust:1.97.1-slim` image (`COPYRIGHT.html` plus the `licenses/` texts it references) |
| base | swig (crossbind fork) | `swig-LICENSE*` | built from crossbind/swig @ `1b6501ab`; only the binary ships, so the texts are copied out of the build stage |
| base | apt packages (cmake, sqlite3, ...) | not duplicated | Debian convention: `/usr/share/doc/<package>/copyright` |
| web | emsdk | `emsdk-LICENSE` | copied from the digest-pinned `emscripten/emsdk` image |
| web | emscripten | `emscripten-LICENSE` | copied from the digest-pinned `emscripten/emsdk` image |
| web | Rust sysroots (`/opt/crossbind/rust`) | `rust/` (same texts as the base toolchain) | rebuilt from the same pinned Rust release |
| web | wasi-sdk | `wasi-sdk-LICENSE` | fetched: WebAssembly/wasi-sdk @ `wasi-sdk-34-rc.3` (the binary tarball ships no texts) |
| web | LLVM (both toolchains' runtimes) | `llvm-LICENSE.TXT` | fetched: llvm/llvm-project @ `7196f931f212` (wasi-sdk's clang revision; the same text governs the emsdk-side LLVM) |
| web | wasi-libc | `wasi-libc-LICENSE*` | fetched: WebAssembly/wasi-libc @ `2e6fb9d8ee0c` (wasi-sdk's pinned submodule) |
| android | Android NDK | `ndk-NOTICE`, `ndk-NOTICE.toolchain` | copied from the NDK root; the NDK is additionally governed by the Android SDK license terms accepted at image build time |
