# React Native - How it Works?
:::caution
This implementation is in the Proof of Concept phase.

In React Native, to enable direct access from JavaScript to C++, Js engines implemented bridge methods called JSI (JavaScript Interface). With JSI, two-way function calls are possible, and simple data types can be converted between JavaScript and C++. Additionally, a 32-bit memory region is opened for sharing using array buffers.

On the web side, I used Embind, a high-level bridge wrapper, which, in turn, utilizes web assembly's low-level bridge methods to encompass the entire C++ language. Moreover, I implemented Embind into Swig for the automatic generation of bridges.

## react-native-embind
I decided to use Embind in React Native as well. This way, I could have a standardized approach between web and React Native without the need for additional work on Swig. The most challenging part was figuring out how to run Embind, designed for WebAssembly and Emscripten, in React Native.

Embind consists of two stages: C++ and JavaScript files. The JavaScript file is generated with the help of a script. I first modified the script to produce the most minimal JavaScript possible. Then, I took these JavaScript and C++ files and created a new project, ensuring they could be independently compiled.

I meticulously converted the WebAssembly bridges used in Embind to JSI bridges. I created functions for data type conversions. In some cases, direct read/write operations from memory were necessary, so I kept four 32-bit memory areas shared.

Although I have ported most of Embind's features, it is still not fully completed. Also, currently, I have only tested it on Android.

## react-native-cppjs
To test the React Native Embind implementation, I created a React Native plugin. As React Native's C++ Turbo Native Modules currently do not support autolinking, I initiated the C++ code from the Java side for now.

Once it matures, I plan to move this project to the cpp.js repository and integrate it into the general system.
