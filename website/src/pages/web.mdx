# Web - How it Works?
I am compiling C++ files to WebAssembly using Emscripten. When I started this project, I wanted to test the capabilities of Emscripten to see how successful it is. If Emscripten could only convert simple code and fail in most operations, this project would not make any sense.

## Gdal3.js - Port of Gdal to Webassembly
To test the abilities of Emscripten, I first attempted to make the Gdal project, which was originally written for desktop and had many dependencies, accessible on the web. In doing so, I compiled Gdal along with proj, geos, spatialite, sqlite, geotiff, tiff, webp, jpeg, expat, zlib, and iconv. The successful compilation and functioning of all these libraries demonstrated the impressive capabilities of Emscripten. By developing Gdal3.js, I gained considerable experience with Emscripten and WebAssembly and sought to test Emscripten further with a more challenging project.

## Full Port of Carto Mobile SDK to Webassembly
The Carto Mobile SDK is a large map library written in C++ that uses OpenGL for Android and iOS platforms. This project involves making the library fully accessible on the web by porting it to C++ and creating bridges for iOS and Android using Swig. Porting this library to the web would demonstrate Emscripten's readiness for widespread use. Additionally, this project offered an opportunity to automate the compilation of C++ code to WebAssembly.

**Cmake**  
I began by analyzing how the project was structured. Common code was written in C++, and there was a CMakeLists.txt file responsible for compiling it. Some parts of this file were specific to each platform, so I customized it for Emscripten to enable compilation for WebAssembly. Although compiling the code was a significant step, it was not sufficient on its own. I continued examining the project.

**Platform Specific Codes**  
The project contained platform-specific codes for platforms like Android and iOS, each residing in its respective folder. These codes included map view, asset utils, bitmap utils, bitmap canvas, network, and thread classes. I created a class called "emscripten" and ported all of these to make them compatible with Emscripten.

**Swig**  
The final step was to write bridges for the classes to make them accessible from JavaScript. The project used Swig for this purpose, which automatically generated bridges. I integrated Emscripten into Swig to create bridges for WebAssembly. However, Swig's lack of support for function overloading based on types posed an issue, so I implemented this feature in the Emscripten project. Moreover, triggering listeners on a separate thread caused problems because JavaScript runs on the main thread. While porting Emscripten to Swig, I ensured that the listener triggering process was queued and executed on the main thread.

After these steps, the project was successfully ported to WebAssembly. However, I encountered numerous challenges and had to solve each one individually, but I won't delve into them here to avoid complicating the narrative.

## Webpack Plugin and Loader
One of the purposes of this project was to allow users to use C++ code in JavaScript files with the same ease as they use other JavaScript code. To achieve this, I created plugins for bundlers that handle all operations behind the scenes when the user imports a C++ header into a JS file.

With the Webpack loader, I replace the line where the header is imported with the loading of the WebAssembly module. Additionally, I generate the necessary Swig interface files for the relevant headers, making only the imported code compile-ready.

With the Webpack plugin, I first create the Swig bridges and then compile the project to WebAssembly.

## Rollup Plugin
With the Rollup plugin, I perform similar tasks as with the Webpack plugin. I replace the line where the header is imported with the loading of the WebAssembly module and generate the necessary Swig interface files for the relevant headers. During the project's compilation, I first create the Swig bridges and then compile the project to WebAssembly.

## Vite Plugin
Vite uses Rollup as its bundler, but it has limited methods it allows. While I can build the project, it doesn't serve the resulting WebAssembly files when running in the development environment. To address this limitation, I created a Vite plugin.
