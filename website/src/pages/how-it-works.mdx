# How it works?
This project aims to create a universe for developers, adding my perspective to the new technologies currently in the alpha/beta phase. My goal is to demonstrate that seemingly impossible things can be achieved by utilizing technology correctly. Due to the highly advanced technical level of this project, I will describe its progress from beginning to end in a step-by-step manner.

## Embind
To enable communication between the C++ language and JavaScript, it is necessary to write a bridge. The bridge methods provided by platforms are low-level and have limited capabilities. Therefore, throughout the project, I have utilized Embind, a high-level bridge wrapper that encompasses most of C++'s features. Embind is one of the most exquisite projects I have come across, although it does have some shortcomings. One of these is the lack of support for function overloading based on parameter types. To address this, I ensured its support by creating a Pull Request (PR) in the Emscripten project.

**PR:** <https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/pull/17445/files>  

## Mobile Swig
In order for the C++ files to be readable from the JavaScript side, a bridge for C++ needed to be created, as indicated in the Embind documentation. Swig is a remarkable project that automatically generates bridges to various languages from C++. However, Swig does not support Embind. To address this, I forked Swig and added support for Embind.

**PR:** <https://github.com/CartoDB/mobile-swig/pull/3/files>  

## CMake
I used CMake to compile the C++ files and prepared the CMakeLists.txt file. Additionally, I planned and implemented how other cpp.js libraries would be used.

**Doc:** <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html>  
**CMakeLists.txt:** <https://github.com/bugra9/cpp.js/blob/main/packages/cppjs-app-cli/src/assets/CMakeLists.txt>

## Docker
To ensure that the project runs properly with the necessary software such as Swig and Emscripten, including the patches I wrote, I prepared a Dockerfile. This avoids potential errors that could arise from manual setups.

**Dockerfile:** <https://github.com/bugra9/cpp.js/blob/main/packages/cppjs-util-docker/Dockerfile>  
**Docker Image:** <https://hub.docker.com/r/bugra9/cpp.js>  

## cppjs-app-cli
To manage the project effectively, I needed a central package that would handle configurations, access relevant applications via Docker image, and execute compilation commands sequentially. Moreover, it should be callable from both the command-line interface (CLI) and triggered by node.js. With these requirements in mind, I created the cppjs-app-cli project, encompassing all these functionalities.

## cppjs-create-skeleton-tool
In order to allow users to quickly begin their projects and download sample projects based on their choices, I required a script. Together with my friend Korhan Ã–zbek, I developed this script.

## Last Words
The above-mentioned software components constitute the main elements of the project. Further software components will be tailored to the specific platforms they will be used on, and I have explained them separately on distinct pages.
