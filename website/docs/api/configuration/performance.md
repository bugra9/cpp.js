# Performance — Defaults & Safe Overrides

cpp.js picks production-grade defaults for every Emscripten and CMake flag. **Most apps should change nothing.** This page lists every default cpp.js sets, marks each as "safe to override" or "don't touch", and shows when to reach for a tweak.

The rule: **if your build runs and your app works, the defaults are fine**. Only touch performance flags after measuring.

## What's safe to override

### `INITIAL_MEMORY` (default: 16MB Wasm default)

If you allocate large objects on startup (loading a model, opening a large geo dataset), the runtime grows memory dynamically — but you'll see growth pauses. Pre-allocating reduces pauses:

```js
// cppjs.config.js
targetSpecs: [{
    platform: 'wasm',
    specs: { emccFlags: ['-sINITIAL_MEMORY=64MB'] },
}]
```

Sweet spot: pre-allocate ~2× your steady-state usage. Going higher just delays startup.

### `MAXIMUM_MEMORY` (default: ~2GB on wasm32)

Browser cap is ~4GB on wasm32. If you genuinely need more (large geospatial / scientific datasets), use **wasm64** target instead:

```js
// cppjs.config.js
target: { arch: 'wasm64' }
```

Don't try to push wasm32 past 4GB — Wasm spec doesn't allow it.

### `PTHREAD_POOL_SIZE` (default: `Math.min(navigator.hardwareConcurrency || 1, 2)`)

The default expression is evaluated by Emscripten at module load (not baked at build time):

- Caps the pool at **2 worker threads**, even on 16-core devices.
- Falls back to **1** if `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` is unavailable (older browsers, Node, edge runtimes).

Why the cap? Each pthread is a Web Worker — non-trivial memory footprint, startup latency, and WASM heap duplication. For typical workloads two workers (main + one) covers parallelism; going past 2 trades memory and load time for diminishing returns. Bump only when you've measured CPU-bound parallelism that scales further.

Paired with `-sPTHREAD_POOL_SIZE_STRICT=2`: if your code requests more pthreads than the pool, the runtime **aborts**. No dynamic growth, no main-thread deadlock risk. If you bump the pool, also relax strictness or keep your spawn count under the new cap.

Override scenarios:

- **CPU-bound parallelism that benefits from more workers** (tile-by-tile image processing, parallel decoding) — bump the pool and relax strict mode:
  ```js
  targetSpecs: [{
      platform: 'wasm', runtime: 'mt',
      specs: { emccFlags: ['-sPTHREAD_POOL_SIZE=8', '-sPTHREAD_POOL_SIZE_STRICT=1'] },
  }]
  ```
- **Want even less memory pressure** — pin to one worker:
  ```js
  targetSpecs: [{
      platform: 'wasm', runtime: 'mt',
      specs: { emccFlags: ['-sPTHREAD_POOL_SIZE=1'] },
  }]
  ```

Past `hardwareConcurrency` real cores, context-switching costs dominate anyway.

### `RESERVED_FUNCTION_POINTERS` (default: 200)

If you see `Cannot enlarge function table` at runtime, bump this:

```js
targetSpecs: [{ specs: { emccFlags: ['-sRESERVED_FUNCTION_POINTERS=1024'] } }]
```

Most apps never hit this. Function pointers are used by virtual methods, `std::function` captures, and JS callbacks into C++.

### Android API level

Default `android-33` (Android 13). Lower if you support older devices:

```js
targetSpecs: [{
    platform: 'android',
    specs: { cmake: ['-DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-26'] },  // Android 8.0
}]
```

Don't go below 26 unless you absolutely have to — older NDK lacks key APIs (e.g. `aligned_alloc`, modern `<filesystem>`).

### iOS deployment target

Default `13.0`. Lower if you support older iOS:

```js
targetSpecs: [{
    platform: 'ios',
    specs: { cmake: ['-DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=12.0'] },
}]
```

Don't go below 12.0 — older iOS lacks the C++17 standard library features cpp.js auto-generated code uses.

### `JSPI` (experimental)

Lets C++ code synchronously await JS promises. Works in Node behind `--experimental-wasm-jspi` and in Chromium for st browser builds; Firefox/WebKit lack the API, and mt (pthreads) browser builds must NOT enable it — see the availability matrix in [C++ binding rules](/docs/api/cpp-bindings/overview). Use only when you have a specific cross-boundary async pattern (background fetching mid-C++):

```js
targetSpecs: [{
    platform: 'wasm',
    specs: { emccFlags: ['-sJSPI'] },
}]
```

Cost: larger Wasm binary (~10-20% bigger), slower call boundary. Only enable if you measure improvement. Pair with the `_JSPI` naming convention — see [C++ binding rules](/docs/api/cpp-bindings/overview).

## What NOT to override

### `-O3` (release)

Always use `-O3` in release. Don't switch to `-O2` or `-Os` thinking you'll get a smaller binary — `-O3` produces faster *and* often smaller output for typical C++ workloads.

### `-fwasm-exceptions`

Required. Without it, C++ exceptions either silently abort or use the slower legacy emulation.

### `-sFORCE_FILESYSTEM=1`, `-sWASMFS`

Required. cpp.js's fs adapters (browser-fs, node-fs) depend on these. Disabling breaks `m.FS.*`.

### `-sMODULARIZE=1`, `-sEXPORT_NAME=Module2`

Required. cpp.js's runtime entry assumes the modular wrapper with this exact export name.

### `-sDYNAMIC_EXECUTION=0`

Disabling re-enables `eval` / `new Function` inside the Wasm runtime. Breaks CSP-strict deployments.

### `-msimd128`

Already optimal for Wasm. Removing it removes a free 2-4× speedup on supported workloads.

## Common "performance" mistakes

### "I'll switch to `-Os` for smaller bundle"

`-O3 + bundler-side dead code elimination` already produces smaller binaries than `-Os` for typical apps. Measure before assuming.

### "I'll disable `ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH` for predictable allocation"

You'll just hit "out of memory" in the first user interaction that needs more than `INITIAL_MEMORY`. Memory growth is cheap; OOM crashes aren't.

### "I'll disable `WASMFS` since I don't need files"

cpp.js's adapter layer assumes `m.FS` exists. Disabling breaks even simple operations like reading a file you bundled into the `.data` preload.

### "I'll remove `-fwasm-exceptions` since my code doesn't throw"

Your C++ might not throw, but `std::vector` / `std::string` / `std::map` can. Removing exception support causes them to abort instead of throwing — silent crashes.

### "I'll bump `PTHREAD_POOL_SIZE` to 32 for max parallelism"

Each pthread is a Web Worker with its own WASM instance — bumping pool size to 32 inflates memory and module startup time without a matching speedup. The default caps at 2 deliberately: enough to parallelize the hot path, cheap to spin up. Bump only when measurement shows your workload scales (e.g. embarrassingly parallel image / geo / crypto loops), and pair the bump with `-sPTHREAD_POOL_SIZE_STRICT=1` so spawning more than the new cap doesn't trip the strict abort.

## Profiling

Before reaching for any override, measure:

1. **Browser DevTools Performance tab** — timing breakdown of JS / Wasm calls.
2. **Wasm-side `printf`** — quick timestamps with `console.debug` (cpp.js's `print` hook).
3. **Memory tab** — heap profile to see allocation patterns.
4. **Lighthouse / PageSpeed** — Wasm bundle download is part of FCP / LCP.

Don't optimize speculatively. The defaults handle 99% of workloads.
