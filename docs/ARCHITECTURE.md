## Key abstractions

### Targets (the unit of build work)

A **target** is a `{platform, arch, runtime, runtimeEnv, buildType}` tuple — e.g. `wasm-wasm32-mt-release-browser`, `wasi-wasm32-st-release` or `ios-iphoneos-mt-release`. The inventory's single source is `core/crossbind/src/utils/targets.js` (state and the wasi command runner both read it). CLI flags (`-p`, `-a`, `-r`, `-e`, `-b`) filter which targets actually build; defaults try the full matrix that the host can support.

### Runtime adapters (JS layer)

The user-facing JavaScript loader is composed from a shared `core.js` plus thin per-environment shims under `core/crossbind/src/assets/js-runtime/`:

```
js-runtime/
├── core.js                 ← createInitCrossbind, mergeDeep, locateFile, preRun, …
├── browser.js              ← thin shim: pick adapters
├── node.js                 ← same shape
├── edge.js                 ← same shape
└── adapters/
    ├── path-url.js         ← URL-style locateFile (browser)
    ├── path-fs.js          ← fs path locateFile (node, edge) — factory
    ├── fs-browser.js       ← OPFS, autoMountFiles, _createVector
    ├── fs-node.js          ← getPreloadedPackage, FS.readFile helpers
    └── worker-comlink.js   ← Comlink + Embind bridge for browser workers
```

Adding a new runtime (e.g. Deno) ≈ writing one `<runtime>.js` shim that composes the right adapters.

### C++ runtime (native bridge)

`core/crossbind/src/assets/cpp-runtime/` holds the C++ side: `browser.cpp`, `node.cpp`, `commonBridges.cpp`, `crossbindEmptySource.cpp`. These get linked by `buildWasm` along with the user's library and any package's `bridge` outputs.

### Plugins (bundler integrations)

Each `plugins/*` adapts crossbind's outputs to one bundler. They share a small contract:

- Watch native source dirs (`paths.native`) so bundler HMR triggers `createLib`/`buildWasm` rebuilds.
- Pipe `/crossbind.js`, `/crossbind.wasm`, `/crossbind.data.txt` requests to dev-server middleware.
- Set COOP/COEP headers when multithread is in use.

`plugins/rollup` is the inner kernel; `plugins/vite` wraps it; `plugins/webpack` is parallel; `plugins/react-native` + `plugins/metro` handle RN.

### Packages (prebuilt C++ libs)

A `ports/<X>` family is a base package + per-arch sub-packages:

```
ports/zlib/
├── base/       ← brand package: recipe body (build.mjs) + upstream license truth
├── wasm/       ← per-platform prebuilt + crossbind.config.js + crossbind.build.js
├── android/
├── ios/
└── wasi/       ← wasi (wasm32-wasip3) prebuilt
```

Sub-packages declare workspace deps to other `@crossbind/port-*-<arch>` they need (e.g. `gdal-wasm` lists `proj-wasm`, `tiff-wasm`, …); pnpm derives topological build order from this. Where the upstream ships CLI tools, a `bin-wasi/` sibling publishes them as npm commands; everything those packages ship (tool map, NOTICE/SBOM, provenance, license field) is derived under the Bin & License Contract — `ports/README.md`.

### Samples (canonical integrations)

`examples/` doubles as documentation. When integrating crossbind into a new framework, agents should diff against the closest matching sample first. Two samples are agent-canonical:

- `examples/mobile-reactnative-cli/` — RN-cli reference, with CI bridge fixtures under `ci/crossbind-snapshot/`.
- `examples/lib-prebuilt-matrix/` — minimal C++ library packaging reference (no UI).

## Persistence + caching

- **`<project>/.crossbind/`** — per-project build cache (cmake outputs, bridge files). Safe to delete; rebuilt on next `crossbind build`.
- **`<project>/dist/prebuilt/<target>/`** — package output (consumed by other packages). Treated as authoritative once written; `createLib` / `buildWasm` short-circuit when artifacts exist unless `force` is set.
- **`<project>/dist/<name>.*.{js,wasm,data.txt}`** — final consumer artifacts.

Force semantics: `actions/isSourceNewer.js` compares native source mtimes against the artifact mtime. Plugins and the CLI use this to decide when to bypass the "already built" cache. Manually overriding requires `{ force: true }` on `createLib` / `buildWasm` calls.

## Execution boundaries (Docker, Xcode, Emscripten)

`actions/run.js` shells out to host tools. WASM and Android targets run inside a digest-pinned Docker image (`getDockerImage()`); iOS targets need a darwin host with Xcode installed. WASI is dual-mode: host-run when a local wasi-sdk is configured (`WASI_SDK_PATH` in `~/.crossbind.json` or `CROSSBIND_WASI_SDK_PATH`), otherwise the docker image carries the sdk at `/opt/wasi-sdk`. Cargo builds (`export.type: 'cargo'`) run on the host toolchain. The wasm/android/wasi branches are CI-friendly on Linux runners; iOS branches early-return on non-darwin (`createLib.js:18`, `createXCFramework.js:13`).

## Logger + diagnostics

Build output is funneled through `core/crossbind/src/utils/logger.js` (`log-update` + `picocolors`). Step lines update in place when the terminal is a TTY; non-TTY (CI, pipe) falls back to plain newline output. Errors and rollup warnings unrelated to host code (Node builtins) are suppressed in `actions/buildJs.js`.
