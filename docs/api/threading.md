# Threading — `runtime: 'st'` vs `'mt'`, `useWorker`, and edge limits

> Two orthogonal axes: **threading** (single vs multi-thread Wasm) and **`useWorker`** (whether the Wasm module runs in a Web Worker). Don't confuse them.

## The two axes

```
                    │ runtime: 'st'        │ runtime: 'mt'
────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼─────────────────────────
useWorker: false    │ Default. Main thread │ Wasm runs main-thread,
                    │ Wasm. Smallest setup.│ pthreads via SharedArray-
                    │                      │ Buffer. Needs COOP/COEP.
────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼─────────────────────────
useWorker: true     │ Wasm in 1 Web Worker.│ Wasm in 1 Web Worker;
                    │ Comlink bridge. Main │ pthreads spawn ADDITIONAL
                    │ thread free. Required│ workers from there. Needs
                    │ for OPFS persistence.│ COOP/COEP + Worker support.
```

## When you need each

| You want | Pick |
|----------|------|
| Quickest path to "C++ in browser" | `runtime: 'st'`, no `useWorker` |
| Persistent storage in browser | `runtime: 'st'`, `useWorker: true` |
| CPU-bound parallelism (image / geo / crypto) | `runtime: 'mt'` |
| Both: persistent storage AND parallelism | `runtime: 'mt'`, `useWorker: true` |
| Cloudflare Worker / Deno Deploy / Vercel Edge | `runtime: 'st'` only — `mt` and `useWorker` not supported |
| React Native | `runtime: 'mt'` if perf-sensitive (pthreads via JSI; no COOP/COEP needed) |

## Setting `runtime: 'mt'`

In `cppjs.config.js`:

```js
export default {
  general: { name: 'myapp' },
  paths: { config: import.meta.url },
  target: { runtime: 'mt' },  // ← here
}
```

Two things happen at build time:

1. The Wasm is compiled with `-pthread` (Emscripten flag).
2. Any transitive dependency that's already `mt` keeps the project on `mt`. Conversely, if any dep is `mt`, this project auto-promotes to `mt` (you can't downgrade).

## The COOP/COEP requirement

Multi-threaded Wasm uses `SharedArrayBuffer`, which browsers gate behind **cross-origin isolation**. Your hosting layer must send these response headers:

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

Without them, `SharedArrayBuffer` is `undefined` and the Wasm init silently fails.

### How to verify (in the browser console)

```js
console.log(crossOriginIsolated)   // must be true for `mt`
console.log(typeof SharedArrayBuffer)  // must be 'function'
```

### Per-host configuration

| Host | Config |
|------|--------|
| Vite dev / preview | Auto-injected by `@cpp.js/plugin-vite` |
| Webpack / Rspack dev server | Auto-injected by `@cpp.js/plugin-webpack` |
| Vercel | Add to `vercel.json`: `{ "headers": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "headers": [{ "key": "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy", "value": "same-origin" }, { "key": "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy", "value": "require-corp" }] }] }` |
| Netlify | Add to `_headers`: `/*\n  Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin\n  Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` |
| Cloudflare Pages | `_headers` file (same syntax as Netlify) |
| nginx | `add_header Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy same-origin; add_header Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy require-corp;` |
| Express / Next.js custom server | Set headers via middleware on every response |

### COEP gotcha

`require-corp` blocks cross-origin resources unless they explicitly opt in (`Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin` on the response, or `crossorigin` attribute on `<img>` / `<script>` tags). If your page loads third-party images / fonts / scripts, you'll either need to:

- Switch to `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless` (more permissive, supported in Chrome 96+, Firefox 110+).
- Or proxy third-party assets through your own origin.

### Known environment quirk: Playwright's WebKit ships a broken OPFS backend

In Playwright's bundled WebKit, `navigator.storage.getDirectory()` exists but always
rejects with `UnknownError: The operation failed for an unknown transient reason`.
Threads themselves are fine there — pthreads, SharedArrayBuffer, wasm exceptions and
SIMD all work (verified 2026-07-12 with per-worker instrumentation; real Safari 26.5
works fully, OPFS included). Before the runtime preflight existed this broke mt boots:
the WASMFS OPFS proxy thread swallowed the rejection and `initCppJs` deadlocked with no
console or page error. The runtime now probes `getDirectory()` before mounting and
falls back to `/memfs` with a logged error, so mt modules boot on all three Playwright
engines and the mt playground e2e specs run WebKit again. If you ever see an mt init
hang with zero signals, suspect a blocked storage backend first — presence of the OPFS
API does not mean it works.

## `useWorker: true` (independent of threading)

Wasm runs in a single dedicated Web Worker; main thread receives a Comlink-bridged proxy.

```js
const m = await initCppJs({ useWorker: true })
// m looks identical, but every call is async.
const result = await m.add(2, 3)
```

You want this when:

- You need OPFS persistent storage (mandatory; OPFS is Worker-scope-only).
- Your C++ is slow and you don't want to block the main thread paint loop.
- You're using `runtime: 'mt'` and want pthread workers spawned from a non-main scope (cleaner architecture).

You don't need it when:

- The C++ is fast (sub-frame) and main-thread blocking doesn't matter.
- You're already using `mt` for parallelism (pthread workers are separate from `useWorker`).

### What changes when `useWorker: true`

| Aspect | Without worker | With worker |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| `m.add(2, 3)` returns | `5` | `Promise<5>` |
| `m.FS.writeFile(...)` returns | `undefined` | `Promise<undefined>` |
| Synchronous callbacks | Work | Don't work — use returned promises |
| OPFS storage | Throws | Works (if browser supports) |
| Termination | n/a | `initCppJs.terminate()` kills the worker |

Embind objects (vectors, structs) are auto-proxied via cpp.js's custom Comlink transfer handlers. `m.toArray(vec)` and `m.toVector(cls, arr)` work transparently.

## Edge runtime limits (Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Vercel Edge)

These platforms run JavaScript in V8 isolates that **don't expose the Web Worker API**. Therefore:

- ❌ `useWorker: true` — fails (no Worker constructor).
- ❌ `runtime: 'mt'` — fails (pthreads need workers + SharedArrayBuffer).
- ❌ OPFS — fails (browser-only API anyway).
- ✅ `runtime: 'st'` + memory fs — works.

If your use case demands persistence on edge, you need an external service (R2, KV, S3) — call it from JS and feed bytes into Wasm via `m.FS.writeFile(...)`.

## React Native

Pthreads are routed through JSI (no `SharedArrayBuffer`, no COOP/COEP). `runtime: 'mt'` works without any host configuration. `useWorker` is a no-op (n/a — no Web Worker API in RN).

## Common pitfalls

1. **`mt` works in dev but not in prod** — the bundler plugin injects COOP/COEP for dev/preview, but production hosting needs explicit configuration. Look at `crossOriginIsolated` in console; if `false`, the headers are missing.
2. **Mixing `mt` and `st` artifacts in one bundle** — they have incompatible memory layouts. The CLI prevents this at build time but if you manually copy `.wasm` files between projects, you'll see "wasm streaming compile failed" errors.
3. **Calling sync callbacks across `useWorker: true`** — Comlink can't invoke main-thread sync code from worker. If your C++ needs a JS callback, design it as a promise round-trip.
4. **Assuming `runtime: 'mt'` enables `useWorker`** — they're independent. `runtime: 'mt'` without `useWorker` runs pthreads on the main thread; `useWorker: true` without `runtime: 'mt'` runs single-thread Wasm in a worker.
5. **Loading third-party scripts on a COEP page** — `require-corp` blocks them unless they send `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin`. Switch to `credentialless` or proxy.
