// TODO(rename): the project is moving from crossbind to crossbind, shipping as stable 2.0.
// @crossbind/* is not published yet, so `npm create crossbind` and the package names in the
// code samples below only resolve after that publish. DOCS_HOST and REPO_URL deliberately
// still point at crossbind so the links keep working. One open question the rename has to
// answer: do `crossbind.config.js` and `crossbind-agent` follow? (The boot call already landed on
// the brand-neutral `initNative`, exported by every generated module.)
//
// Content note (15 Aug 2026): every figure below is now measured or counted from this repo -
// 16 library recipes, 68 wasi commands, 30 build targets, 20 override points, 9 MCP tools,
// 4 skills, 12 templates, the pinned upstream versions in SHOWCASE, live GitHub counters, and
// the real release notes. The performance section is gone entirely - see the note above
// RUNTIME_CHIPS for the measurements that retired it.
//
// Feature audit (17 Aug 2026): FEATURES was re-checked claim by claim against the source. Four
// statements did not survive and are gone - LTO (no -flto anywhere in the build), "pthreads
// across every core" (the pool is capped at two workers in buildWasm.js), unqualified
// dead-code elimination (Android links whole libraries) and unqualified "zero toolchain setup"
// (iOS needs local Xcode, Rust a local cargo). Do not reintroduce any of them without a commit
// that makes them true.

export const SETUP_PROMPT = `Add crossbind to this project so I can call C++ (or Rust) from JavaScript.

First inspect the repo and tell me what you found: package manager, bundler (Vite, Webpack, Rspack, Rollup, Metro), whether it targets the browser, Node, Cloudflare Workers or React Native, and any existing C++/Rust sources or CMake project.

Then:

1. Install \`crossbind\` and the plugin matching my bundler (\`@crossbind/plugin-vite\`, \`@crossbind/plugin-webpack\`, \`@crossbind/plugin-rspack\`, \`@crossbind/plugin-rollup\`, \`@crossbind/plugin-metro\`).
2. Create \`crossbind.config.js\` at the repo root and register the plugin in my bundler config. Keep the change idempotent - do not duplicate an existing entry.
3. If I already have C++ or Rust sources, wire those up. Otherwise add one small example: a header under \`src/native/\`, imported directly from JavaScript.
4. Call \`await initNative()\` once at my app's entry point, before the first native call - import it from the header or crate the app already imports, not from a separate runtime package.
5. Run my build and report what changed, including the size of the generated WebAssembly.

Rules: do not hand-write binding or glue code - crossbind generates it from the header. Do not add a second build system. If I need a prebuilt library (GDAL, OpenSSL, SQLite, GEOS, PROJ and more), install the matching \`@crossbind/port-*\` instead of compiling it from source.
